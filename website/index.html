          <h1>About us</h1>
          <p>Coffee
            Our coffee beans are roasted twice per week and we receive them the next day to ensure their freshness for both the beverages we make in house and the retail beans we offer for sale.
            We have carefully selected Zingerman’s Coffee out of our neighboring city, Ann Arbor, MI as our exclusive roaster for many factors including the close relationships they have with their coffee farmers as well as the ethical means by which they purchase their products. Zingerman’s roasts small batches of coffee beans often and cups them continually to ensure they’re getting the best flavor possible. Our Cold Brew, also from Zingerman’s, is unlike any in the area. Only specific beans from South America and Indonesia are used for the preparation of Zingerman’s Cold Brew, they are coarsely ground and steep for 16 hours at 42 degrees. This concentrate is then either bottled for a quick refreshing beverage on the go or used in our iced coffee’s and frozen beverages!</p>
            <h1>Our mission</h1>
            <P>Our mission has always been to find the best coffee from around the world and show everyone exactly how great specialty coffee can be. We search the world so you don’t have to. A passion for coffee that has been cared for, and is loved from the moment it’s planted to the moment it’s brewed, is why we exist.
              Our coffee experts travel the world sourcing, tasting and grading to select only the finest speciality coffee directly from the grower. This way, we control all the variables every step of the way to make sure the coffee we deliver is perfect.
              We try to select the world’s best locations for our single origins, and wherever possible we source this coffee direct trade. Our search for the best coffee doesn’t stop at finding the best tasting coffee; we want to ensure we are responsible for positive action at every step of the coffee supply chain.
              We love great coffee and know you do too. That’s why we make it easy for you. We deliver specialty grade coffee sourced from around the world and then expertly roasted and delivered to your home, office, coffee shop, deli, or restaurant.
              Each and every day, we set out to make the best tasting coffee we can. We work with dedicated and passionate people throughout the coffee world to seek out great coffees, and shake hands with the farmers and the families that produce them.
              To help you get the best out of our coffee we continually search the world for the best brewing methods and solutions, and make them available for fast delivery along with each of our coffees.
              Coffee comes from some of the most fascinating corners of the planet, and every specialty coffee bean has a story. We want to share those stories and make those coffees available to you with an emphasis on quality, freshness, customer service and convenienceWhat we don’t roast ourselves, we carefully select from only the best roasters in the country to sell in our Speciality Coffee Shop.
              Our own Specialty coffee is roasted in one of the most high-tech roasters in the country. We wanted to find equipment that can consistently roast the exact profiles we wanted, every time
              We are extremely passionate about great coffee and we want to provide you with the tools to understand everything about it</P>
